if $p$ is a prime number and $a$ is not divisible by $p$ then,
- $a^p\ \%\ p = a\ \%\ p$
- and $a^{p - 1}\ \%\ p = 1$
- and $a^{-1}\ \%\ p = a^{p - 2}\ \%\ p$ ----> important for factions and Combinations

**Correction:** In the case of fractions, Not if $p$ is prime, but if and only if $gcd(a,\ p) = 1$. 
In other words, the denominator must be *relatively prime* to the modulus.
