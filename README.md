# My Competitive Programming Notes

A personal collection of competitive programming notes and techniques learned through practice, organized as an Obsidian vault for enhanced learning and navigation.

## üìã Overview

This repository contains my personal notes on various topics in competitive programming that I've learned through practice or that were new to me. Rather than being comprehensive explanations or tutorials, these notes capture insights, techniques, and approaches I've discovered while solving problems. The repository is organized to highlight connections between different concepts I've encountered.

**For the best experience**, it's recommended to view this project as an Obsidian vault to take advantage of the interconnected structure and tags.
