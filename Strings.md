- if the string is palindrome then it contains 2 adjacent letters that are the same or there are two letters separated by another which are the same.
	**Some usage:** if there aren't any 2 equal adjacent letters or separated by char, then this string is not palindrome and all its substrings(with size $\ge$ 2) are not palindromes.
