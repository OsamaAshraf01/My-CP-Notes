Let's denote the sum of all factors of N except for N itself as $S_n$, then:
- if $S_n = n$, then this number is [perfect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number).
- if $S_n < n$, then this number is [deficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deficient_number).
- if $S_n > n$, then this number is [abundant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundant_number).

And there is much more details inside those categories. For more details revise [Divisor function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisor_function)
